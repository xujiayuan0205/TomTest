## 🌟 Overview

**RecToM** is a benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the **Theory of Mind (ToM)** capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) within **recommendation dialogues**.  
LLMs must infer users’ **Beliefs**, **Desires**, and **Intents** during multi-turn interactions—skills essential for building context-aware and effective recommender systems.

### 🔍 Key Features

#### 🧭 Multi-choice Strategy  
A single utterance may express **multiple distinct intentions**. RecToM captures this natural conversational complexity.

#### 🔎 Multi-granular Intentions  
Intentions are **hierarchical**: an utterance may contain both a high-level purpose and fine-grained contextual sub-intentions.

#### 📚 Multi-dimensional Beliefs  
Beliefs about items (e.g., movies) involve multiple interconnected aspects:  
who introduces the item, whether the seeker has watched it, and their levels of preference or acceptance.

#### 🎯 Multi-concurrent Desires  
Users frequently pursue **multiple goals simultaneously**, such as exploring new items while comparing alternatives.
